### DEEPCON with sequence features as input
Trained and validated using the 3456 proteins in the DeepCov dataset with the following features predicted from the sequence:
* Psipred - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10869041 
* Psisolv - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10869041
* Shannon entropy sum - features from the .colstat file generated by the alnstat program in MetaPSICOV - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25431331
* Ccmpred - https://github.com/soedinglab/CCMpred
* Freecontact - https://rostlab.org/owiki/index.php/FreeContact
* Pstat_pots - features from the .pairstat file generated by the alnstat program in MetaPSICOV - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25431331

#### Generate feature file
```bash
./deepcon-seq-step1.pl 5ptpA.aln 5ptpA
```
#### Predict RR
```bash
python ./deepcon-seq-step2.py --feat 5ptpA/5ptpA.input.features --rr 5ptpA.rr
```
